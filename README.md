# Degen Devs
- Built a web server and API for providing the features using the RESTful architecture
- Ran a local node of IPFS
- Uploaded 10 images to this node
- Created a JSON and build metadata descriptions for 10 NFTs, each using one unique image
- Made two GET method in the API to get the metadata by id and to get all metadata
- Deployed a NFT Collection and minted 10 NFTs, and assign the API endpoint to the token URI
- Integrated this NFT Collection contract and APIs in a frontend application to display NFTs metadata and images

Next Steps:
provide wallet functions in the frontend to buy, transfer, allow, transfer from and burn NFTs!
